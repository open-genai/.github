_Abstract_
> Large language models that exhibit instruction-following behaviour represent one of the biggest recent upheavals in conversational interfaces, a trend in large part fuelled by the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, a proprietary large language model for text generation fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback (LLM+RLHF). We review the risks of relying on proprietary software and survey the first crop of open-source projects of comparable architecture and functionality. The main contribution of this paper is to show that openness is differentiated, and to offer scientific documentation of degrees of openness in this fast-moving field. We evaluate projects in terms of openness of code, training data, model weights, reinforcement learning data, licensing, scientific documentation, and access methods. We find that while there is a fast-growing list of projects billing themselves as 'open source', many inherit undocumented data of dubious legality, few share the all-important RLHF components (a key site where human annotation labour is involved), and careful scientific documentation is exceedingly rare. Degrees of openness are relevant to fairness and accountability at all points, from data collection and curation to model architecture, and from training and fine-tuning to release and deployment.

# Guide
We have three things here:
1. A [live table](https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/) of open LLM+RLHF projects with fine-grained data on degrees of openness
2. A repository holding [the underlying data](https://github.com/opening-up-chatgpt/opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/tree/main/projects), in human readable yaml files open for community contributions
3. An more free-form [awesomelist](https://github.com/opening-up-chatgpt/opening-up-chatgpt.github.io##opening-up-chatgpt-a-curated-list-to-track-openness-transparency-and-accountability-in-instruction-following-text-generators-) of open ChatGTP alternatives projects that we use to crowdsource discovery of new models
